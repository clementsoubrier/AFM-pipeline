# AFM pipeline
Implementation of an automated pipeline for AFM data analysis : 

'main_run' enables to run the whole pipelines on different datasets

'scaled_parameters' are all the parameters used in the pipeline, as well as paths and datasets

'processing' : raw data treatment and segmentation

'complete_centerlines' : computation of cell centerlines

'plot_final_lineage_tree' : cell tracking 

'peaks_troughs' and 'Centerlines' folders are used for statistical analysis

'data_description' : description of the data structure once the data is processed
